## 1. Core Components

### 1.1 Interview Graph
Implements the main interview logic as a **directed LangGraph**, where each node represents a stage of the interview process â€” setup, question generation, answer evaluation, and final summary.

### 1.2 Stateful Interview Management
Maintains all session variables such as CV data, current step, generated questions, and recorded responses throughout the interview session.

### 1.3 AI Service
- **Gemini** powers dynamic question generation and answer evaluation using the CV as the content source.

### 1.4 Prompts and Configuration
Uses structured prompt templates and environment-driven configuration to ensure consistency and security across different interview sessions.

### 1.5 Logging
Includes structured terminal logging for all key steps, making debugging and tracking straightforward.

### 2.2 Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys.  
You can refer to the `.env_example` file included in the project for required variables.

---

### 2.3 Setup Steps

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/macOS

### 2.4 Running the Application

Once setup is complete, launch the chatbot from your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

Youâ€™ll be prompted to:

1. Provide a **candidate CV** (e.g., PDF, text, or structured input).
2. Choose the **question type** â€“ `broad_followup`, `narrow_followup`, `broad_nonfollowup`, or `narrow_nonfollowup`.

The system will then conduct a complete AI-driven interview session based entirely on the provided CV.
