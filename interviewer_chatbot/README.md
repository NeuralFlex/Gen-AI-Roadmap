Each node handles a stage of the interview (setup, question generation, answer evaluation, and final summary).

### 1.2 State Management
`graph/state.py` defines `InterviewState`, which maintains all session variables such as topic, current step, and responses.

### 1.3 Gemini & Tavily Integration
- **`services/gemini_client.py`** ‚Äì Handles question generation and answer evaluation using the Gemini API.  
- **`services/tavily_client.py`** ‚Äì Provides contextual content and background knowledge via Tavily API.

### 1.4 Configuration & Prompts
- **`config/prompts.py`** ‚Äì Contains predefined prompt templates for interviews.  
- **`config/settings.py`** ‚Äì Loads API keys and environment settings.

### 1.5 Logging
